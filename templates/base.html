        Ettori Bugatti was the legendary founder of the Bugatti company and the
        designer of the most successful race cars and luxurious vehicles of his
        day. Known as a major pioneer within automotive engineering and his name
        has lived on, beyond his passing to produce automobiles that would have
        made him proud had he lived on. Modern day Bugatti's have walked the
        fine line between between speed and luxury. Until the Veyron and Chiron
        it was safe to say not many automobiles that focused on speed managed to
        incorporate luxury in their models also.

          The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed and
          developed in Germany by Bugatti Engineering GmbH and manufactured in
          Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti
          Automobiles S.A.S. The successor to the Bugatti Veyron, the Chiron was
          first shown at the Geneva Motor Show on 1 March 2016. The car's design
          was initially previewed with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept
          car unveiled at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show. The car is named after
          the Mon√©gasque driver Louis Chiron. The car shares the name with the
          1999 Bugatti 18/3 Chiron concept car.
