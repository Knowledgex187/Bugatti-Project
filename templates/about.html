  Ettori Bugatti was the legendary founder of the Bugatti company and the
  designer of the most successful race cars and luxurious vehicles of his day.
  Known as a major pioneer within automotive engineering and his name has lived
  on, beyond his passing to produce automobiles that would have made him proud
  had he lived on. Modern day Bugatti's have walked the fine line between
  between speed and luxury. Until the Veyron and Chiron it was safe to say not
  many automobiles that focused on speed managed to incorporate luxury in their
  models also.
